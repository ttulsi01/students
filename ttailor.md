# About me
I was born in India and moved here a couple of years ago with my family. I can speak and read four languages(English, Hindi, Gujarati, and Sanskrit). I started coding in Java when I was in high school and explored more languages in college. 

For fun, I enjoy reading and watching sci-fi, fantacy, and action movies. My favorite website is [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com). Also, I love traveling.
