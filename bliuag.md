My name is Blaine Liuag, I am 21 years old and attend the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.
I was born in Los Angeles, California where I lived until I was around 13.

Some of my interests (apart from computer science obviously) are...
- Creative Writing
- Traveling & Camping
- Language Learning (Spanish, Japanese)
- Bossa Nova Music
- Kendo

Kendo is a recent interest of mine which started at UT. Kendo is a martial art which is somewhat akin to western fencing.
